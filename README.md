Steps: 
1. Project setup - set up all the assets you need including the images, javascript file, css file, html file, pdf file for my resume. Store everything in the folder named "assets" and make a new folder for each: css, js, and img. For the html, keep it outside of asset folder. 
2. Set up your file - includes linking your css and js to your html, make an outline as comment like below: 
<!-- ============================= HEADER ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= SWIPER CSS ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= MAIN CSS ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= HEADER ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= FOOTER ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= SWIPER JS ============================= -->
<!-- ============================= MAIN JS JS ============================= -->
3. Go to unicons and copy the URL there. Also go to Google fonts website and pick your desired font style. For example, in this project I chose Poppins (Regular 400, Medium 500, and SemiBold 600) all at once. Now, choose the import and only copy this URL do not include the <style></style> 
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600&display=swap');
Copy that @import to your CSS under GOOGLE FONTS 
4. Work on the Variable CSS (:root)
5. Reset HTML
